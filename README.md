# Machine-Learning-Foundation
1. Predicting house prices, create models that predict a continuous value (prices) from input features (square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms,...).
2. Analyzing sentiment, create models that predict a class (positive/negative sentiment) from input features (text of the reviews, user profile information,...)
3. Retrieving documents, examine various document representations and an algorithm to retrieve the most similar subset, structured representations of the documents that automatically group articles by similarity (e.g., document topic).
4. Recommender system using a variety of techniques, and explore their tradeoffs, specifically matrix factorization.
5. Building an image classifier and an intelligent image retrieval system with deep learning.
